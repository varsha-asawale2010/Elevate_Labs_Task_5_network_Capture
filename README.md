## Identify at Least 3 Different Protocols

DNS (Domain Name System):Translates domain names github.com into  their IP addresses.
Look for packets where your computer queries a DNS server to resolve a domain name.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring web pages.
Identify HTTP GET or POST requests when accessing websites.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Establishes and maintains a connection between devices for data transmission.
Notice the three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) when initiating a connection.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):Used for diagnostic purposes, like the ping command.
See echo request and reply packets when you ping a server.
